Modify code to meet accessibility standards


## Description 

This precoded landing page has its code modified to increase its accessibilty to screen readers.
Semantic tags replace a lot of the div tags to give each area more context and meaning.

This update solves the problem of an inaccessible landing page by using semantic html which is accessible to each browser and screen readers.

I learned which tags were considered semantic and they can have classes assigned to them to be controlled through css.
Semantic tags can operate like div tags but are more descriptive to help users contextualise the content of the page.
